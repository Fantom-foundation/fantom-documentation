Introduction
============

Distributed Computing in a decentralized context is currently only as
efficient as the consensus winning node. The goal is to have the
combined computing power of all participants. Instead we have the
computing power of a single node. We propose a cheap, asynchronous,
fault tolerant, verifiable alternative to current decentralized
solutions.

Background
==========

Price of Computing
------------------

The current computing standard is cloud computing services. AWS, Google,
Azure. We will consider AWS as our benchmark.

t2.medium on-demand: $0.0464 per Hour

t2.medium spot-pricing: $0.026 per Hour

t2.medium reserved instance: $0.027 per Hour

Lambda: $0.20 per 1 million requests, $0.00001667 per GB-second of
compute

Aurora(RDS): $0.1 per GB-month, $0.2 per 1 million requests

Cost Example

Low-traffic Account CRUD API (Lambda)

\~400,000 requests per month

$0.25/mo (@200ms per request)

Low-traffic Account CRUD API (Aurora - RDS)

\~400,000 requests per month

$0.3/mo

Comparing an Ethereum Solution

Low-traffic Account CRUD API (Ethereum)

\~400,000 requests per month (Average between inserts, updates, and
balance requests)

3.3 billion gas @ 50 gwei = 168 ETH = $68,208.00

Cost differential

The principal of a world computer is to be able to leverage all of the
computing capacity of all participating nodes. Given the Proof-of-Work
consensus design, only a single block can be created every epoch. All
nodes must execute the same block to arrive at the same state. Thus,
instead of having the cumulative computing power of all nodes, we have
the computing power of a single node.

Compute vs Storage
------------------

AWS S3: $0.023 / GB

AWS Glacier $0.004 / GB

There is no linear correlation between compute capacity, and storage
capacity. Storage and Computing can not be tightly coupled in a
decentralized environment.

Compute Architecture
--------------------

-   CPU/GPU perform stateless computing.

-   Memory allows for temporary fast access storage.

-   Disk allows for permanent\* slow access storage.

Compute architecture leverages off-of the above 3 principals. Fast
computing loads from slow storage what it needs into fast access memory
to allow for computing to manipulate fast access memory and then write
back to slow storage.

Tightly Coupled Architecture
----------------------------

Storage and Compute in Ethereum VM are tightly coupled. They are
inherent in the OPcodes of the virtual machine.

With no correlation between Computing and Storage, and no correlation in
Compute Architecture, this tight coupling must be removed to be
feasible.

Redesigning Stateless Computing
===============================

Network of *n* participants.

Data source of *ds*.

Execution set of *c*.

*1/n* compute nodes executes *c* with inputs *ds*.

Compute Node Risk

1.  Infinite execution time.

2.  Out of memory.

Compute Provider Risk

1.  Node terminates before execution finishes.

2.  Inaccurate execution results.

Problem Statement \#1

The compute node must be able to assess the compute requirements of the
computation.

Problem Statement \#2

The compute node must be able to assess the memory requirements of the
computation.

Problem Statement \#3

The compute provider must be able to have confirmation of execution
results.

Problem Statement \#4

The compute provider must be able to confirm the validity of the
resulting output.

Time Complexity
===============

Constant O(1)

Logarithmic O(log n)

Polylogarithmic O((log n)<sup>k</sup>)

Sub-linear o(n) or O(n<sup>1/2</sup>)

Linear O(n)

Quasilinear O(n log<sup>k</sup> n)

Sub-quadratic o(n<sup>2</sup>)

Polynomial O(n<sup>k</sup>)

Key qualities of a compute job would need to include

-   Determinism

-   Precise computational steps

The Ethereum Virtual Machine established this by linking Gas costs to
each OPcode execution. Thus calculating execution time\* and memory
requirements\* for a given set of inputs. This cost is tightly coupled
with execution.

A compute node can given a set of inputs (data source) and set of
instructions be able to assess the execution and memory requirements of
the specific job.

Job Scheduling

-   Response time and bounded slowdown

Given *n* nodes we can make the following assumptions.

-   Optimized efficiency has exactly *1/n* nodes execute the given
    > compute task.

-   Fault tolerance has at least *3/n* nodes execute the given compute
    > task.

-   Multi Party Computing (MPC) for verifiable results has at least 3/n
    > nodes execute the given compute task.

Given that MPC requires *3/n* and fault tolerance requires *3/n*, we
require *9/n* for fault tolerant multi party computation. This is an
optimized strategy.

    > to entry)

Deterministic Verifiable Computing
==================================

Given;

-   Fixed cost Opcodes

-   Verifiable Computing

-   Multi node fault tolerance redundancy

We can accomplish;

-   Fixed length execution assessment

-   Compute cost execution assessment

-   Verifiable Computing Results

-   Fault Tolerance

Decoupling Cost
===============

A fee based token economy marketplace will be required to ensure fair
value.

Tasks are associated with a bid: the amount of coin offered for
performing the task. Bidders can adjust the bid on their pending tasks
to expedite their execution. Workers will decide if a bid is sufficient
for them to execute upon. Workers will execute work when profitable for
them to do so.

A compute node can decide to execute a given job for less than the
expected fee payment. A compute provider can provide a fee less than the
indicated execution cost.

Job Scheduling Conflicts
========================

Given

-   *n* nodes

-   *k* as our fault tolerance variable

We want *k/n* to execute a given job with the following criteria

-   *k* is willing to accept the job based on the OPcode cost

-   *k* is willing to accept the job based on the execution fee proposed

Risk

-   No nodes willing to accept the job (No profitability attack)

-   *&lt; k* nodes are willing to accept the job

-   All nodes are willing to accept the job (Too profitable attack)

Job scheduling with a scheduler is a fairly well established field of
study. In a decentralized environment, we lack a scheduler.

Job Scheduling 
===============

To achieve decentralized job scheduling we discuss the following
strategies

-   *k/n* selection with a first come leader selection

-   Stake based leader selection

-   Cryptographic Sortition participant selection

Job Propagation k/n
-------------------

Job requests are unique. Each node holds a list of all job IDs they have
received.

Each node that receives a request attempts to act as a job scheduler.

Upon receiving a compute request with an empty job order the compute
node *n<sub>1</sub>* confirms if they are willing to accept the job. If
they are, they sign the request, randomly select *k* nodes, adds each to
the job order and propagates to each node.

Each node receiving the request can accept or deny the request. If they
accept, they sign and propagate to the listed job order nodes. If *y*
nodes have accepted, but *k* has not been reached, *n<sub>1</sub>*
elects *k-y* new nodes and continues this cycle. If
*n<sub>1\ </sub>*knows &lt; *k* nodes *t* it sends the job to *t* nodes
and elects one of *t* nodes as the new leader.

Job Schedulers are allowed to collect the fees.

-   Risk of less than *k* nodes known

-   Denial attacks by *n<sub>1</sub>*

-   Centralized towards *n<sub>1</sub>*

-   Long potential job acceptance time

Job Propagation Leader Selection
--------------------------------

Compute nodes stake tokens for leader election. Each epoch a leader
*n<sub>l</sub>* is elected to be the job scheduler. The elected leader
sends out the job request signed with it as leader. Receiving nodes can
validate that *n<sub>l\ </sub>*is the correct leader for the epoch. If a
node is willing to accept the job they sign the request and send back to
the leader. The leader can then choose a subset of nodes to execute the
given job.

Further optimization: Job scheduling based on cryptographic proofs of
resources available\*

Job Schedulers are allowed to collect the fees.

-   Risk of malicious *n<sub>l</sub>*

-   Denial attacks by *n<sub>l</sub>*

-   Fast job acceptance time

-   Further scheduling optimization possible

Job Propagation Cryptographic Sortition
---------------------------------------

Compute nodes each have an algorithmic lottery chance. The job ID is
used as the seed for the Cryptographic Sortition, all nodes willing to
participate, participate in the sortition. Nodes with a winning match
are allowed to participate.

The highest hash seed matching the winning ticket is awarded the fees if
they complete the job.

-   More than *k* participants

Deterministic Verifiable Job Propagation Compute Marketplace
============================================================

Given;

-   Fixed cost Opcodes

-   Verifiable Computing

-   Multi node fault tolerance redundancy

-   Job Propagation

-   Fee decoupling

We can accomplish;

-   Fixed length execution assessment

-   Compute cost execution assessment

-   Verifiable Computing Results

-   Fault Tolerance

-   k/n selection for efficient computing

-   Cost efficient marketplace

Conclusion
==========

A deterministic, verifiable, market value driven, fault tolerant,
asynchronous world compute engine. We allow for multiple verifiable
compute strategies as well as multiple job selection strategies. The
proposal allows for a compute environment that gravitates towards a
market value compute requirement with low cost resources available for
the ecosystem.
